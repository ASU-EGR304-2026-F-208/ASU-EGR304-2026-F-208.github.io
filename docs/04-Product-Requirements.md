## Project Objective
>This project aims to investigate and develop a highly versatile smart power strip with an improved setup, a more reliable interface, and easy to program outlets and USB ports for use in a wide range of electrical applications indoors as well as outdoors. The outcome of this investigation and the prototype that will be created will benefit the industry as a whole, as we are posting all documentation, electrical schematics, code, and CAD files to our github page which is freely viewable and downloadable. We believe that by providing our findings as a public resource it will benefit fellow ASU students taking EGR304 or similar embedded systems classes by providing an example of a project that can serve as inspiration. And, since we are developing a real product it will benefit entrepreneurs or engineering firms looking to actually sell a product like the one we design.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Upper middle class people of 18 years and above. We would like to target money conscious individuals who are looking to learn more about their enegy consumption habits and lower their electricity costs. It is ideally for both tech savy or a non-technical person. 
- **Target purchaser** Our product will be for any homeowners, landlord, renter, or office worker who wants more control over their personal power consumption. It could be a landlord that wants to keep track of how expensive it is to run outdoor security lights outside of their property, or it might be for an office worker who wants to have their desk come to life whenever they are on the way to their office.
- **Customer service & Thid Party Repair** Our product will be simple to troubleshoot remotely, and components should be modular, easy to replace, and readily available to purchase. Maintenance and service will be simple to perform by anyone with basic hand tools.
- **Power Utility Companies** Most utility companies have their own webstores in which they offer energy saving products for their customers. They often have these products discounted with direct to consumer rebates in which the customer is incentivised to use more energy efficient products with a rebate on the item they are purchasing or a credit on their next bill. We expect to be able to provide our product to these utility companies at a high enough margin that would allow us to make a profit while giving the utility companies some room to provide rebates for their consumers.
- **Retailers** We expect the product to be durable enough to be placed in longer term storage in various temperature and humidity conditions. Packaging should be drop safe and impact resistant.

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Emily**
is a 35-year-old mother of two small children. She frequently uses many extension cables for her kids night lights, phone chargers, and living room lamps because she enjoys decorating her house. Emily made the decision to convert to Spark Guard, the smart extension cable with built-in safety safeguards, when her toddler nearly touched an exposed electrical outlet.

Ports are now kept closed when not in use thanks to Spark Guard's child-safe locking cover. Emily is no longer concerned about small, inquisitive hands being close to electricity. The voice-activated solenoid mechanism opens the outlet safely. When she needs to plug something in, she can see when the power is on thanks to the integrated LED indicator, and she can monitor her energy consumption in real time thanks to the digital display.

**User Story #2: Ethan**
is a 22 year old off-campus engineering student, dealing with rising SRP electrical costs as a result of his laptop, gaming setup, and 3D printer. He used the Spark Guard Smart Extension Cord to control his energy usage  and it completely changed the way he tracked power usage. He was able to detect high-usage equipment with the aid of the digital display and switch them off overnight, saving about 20% on his monthly payment.

The voice-activated solenoid lid kept unused outlets locked for safety, while the LED indicator indicated whether current was flowing. The tight lid prevented a short circuit when his roommate spilled a drink close by. Ethan now has peace of mind, safety and energy savings in one stylish gadget thanks to Spark Guard's integration with his smart assistant, which also turns down and locks automatically.
